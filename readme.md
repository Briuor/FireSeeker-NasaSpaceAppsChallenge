### How it Works?

If I ask now, how many fire outbreaks have you had in your country in the last 24 hours, would you know how to answer? According to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics), here in Brazil we have more than 1600, like in Amazon forest, how you may have heard. In a case like this, would you know how to help?

Thinking about it, we created the FireSeeker, an online platform responsible for conducting or matching recruitment institutions, with people who has the desire to help in some situations.

On the platform, you can go two ways:

As a volunteer: where you register with the regions and areas you are interested in helping. With this record, when a fire outbreak is identified, you will receive an alert email of possible recruitment.

As an institution: On the other hand, if you are an institution, such as a civil or federal defense, that is responsible for recruiting volunteers, you will perform another registration where you can set up your volunteer time.
